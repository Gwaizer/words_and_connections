# words_and_connections
<HEAD
My first ever flutter project, an arabic game of words and connections.

The goal of this project was to improve my abilities in flutter and gain some experience in creating a flutter project, while this project wasnt very feature
stacked, it was very helpful and i gained a lot of experience, another goal was to create a fun game for my friends and family.
